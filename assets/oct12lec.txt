10/12 Lecture- Hypothesis Testing, Probability refresher

- What is a hypothesis?

- What's a test statistic?
	- Something that quantifies our samples, both observed and predicted
	- Computing distance between distributions
		- TVD - sum(abs(V1-V2))/2
		- Chi square - n * sum((V1-V2)**2)

- Sampling distribution, probability distribution- we use them interchangably
	- Chance of each value of a statistic

- Empirical distribution
	- A computed distribution from some randomly drawn samples

- Notes on distributions
	- Bias- a systematic error in one direction- eg some instrument measuring a value that is consistenly off- might still be normal, but shifted mean

- Null vs alternative hypothesis
	- Usually null means that your observation was just random
	- Alternative - usually we're looking for some extraordinary outcome, attributed to something other than chance

- Steps of hypothesis testing
	- Select two hypotheses
	- Choose a test statistic
		- This is where TVD or Chi square might come in. Or you could do something like count number of heads, or count number of die rolls above 5, this all depends on the hypotheses you want to test
	- Compute what the null hypothesis would generate
	- Compare the prediction to the distribution under the null
		- This comparison is freqently done with a pvalue
		- "What proportion of observations are as extreme or more extreme than the sample I'm studying?"
		- Biased die- "Under the null, would I expect to see quite this many 6s? or even more?" 
		- You can have one or two tailed, but we pretty much will only care about one tailed
