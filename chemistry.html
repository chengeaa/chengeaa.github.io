                    I've been working with (now Dr.) Tony Rizzuto since the summer of 2015 on studies regarding the effects of solute on the
                    evaporation rate of liquid water. Evaporative cooling rates are determined by performing Raman thermometry on
                    a free falling droplet train generated in vacuum; these can be used to calculate gamma (evaporation coefficient).

                    Surprising Effects of Hydrochloric Acid on the Water Evaporation Coefficient Observed by Raman Thermometry</a>"

                            <b>Abstract:</b> The kinetics and energetics of cloud droplet and aerosol formation in the atmosphere are strongly influenced by the evaporation and condensation rates of water,
                            yet the magnitude and mechanism of evaporation remains incompletely characterized. Of particular import
                            (and controversy) is the nature of interfacial water pH and its potential effects on evaporation rate and environmental reactivity.
                            We have used Raman thermometry measurements of freely evaporating microdroplets to determine evaporation coefficients (γ) for two different hydrochloric acid solutions,
                            both of which result in a significant deviation from γwater.
                            At 95% confidence, we find the evaporation coefficient for 1.0 M HCl to be 0.24 ± 0.04, a ∼60% decrease relative to pure water
                            , and for 0.1 M HCl to be 0.91 ± 0.08, a ∼45% increase relative to pure water. These results suggest a large perturbation in the surface structure induced by either
                            hydronium ions adsorbing to the water surface or by the presence of a Cl–···H3O+ ion-pair moiety in the interfacial region.

                            <b>Abstract:</b> We explore the application of anodization of aluminum as a low cost, efficient,
                            and highly scalable technique useful not only for manipulation of macroscopic properties of materials,
                            but also as a starting point for the creation of nanoscale metallic structures.
                            Using simple chemical setups and software controls, we have been able to selectively anodize aluminum, without affecting underlying substrate.
                            This process has yielded alumina samples suitable for further development

                        <b>Abstract:</b> While the factors affecting piezoelectricity have been well studied in multiple piezoelectric materials,
                        there has not yet been a study on the factors affecting piezoelectricity in crystalline sugar.
                        In this experiment, we explore the effects of temperature and crystal morphology on the piezoelectric effect in crystalline sugar.
                        We attempted synthesis of crystals with two methods, in wells and on dowels. We also used commercially grown crystals for testing.
                        These crystals were subjected to consistent pressures and a temperature range from -50° C to 50° C, and their voltage responses were recorded.
                        In these tests, we determined that there is a positive correlation between increasing temperature and piezoelectric resonse,
                        with the response going to 0 beyond the temperatures at the ends of our range.
                        It is also of interest to note that the typical crystal growing method failed, while the discs produced crystals with structure nearly identical to the commercial crystal.

                        <b>Abstract:</b>MoS2 has been observed to be a compound with favorable electronic properties., with possible applications in small electronics. However, we wanted to analyze the chemical compositions of the samples that we’ve been producing because there have been electric inconsistencies  observed. The chemical study, therefore, is to study exactly what the chemical compositions of these MoS2 nanostructures turn out to be after their manufacturing process, and the correlation of that to the observed electrical properties.
