                To use these notebooks, you'll need to grab the files from Github. To do this, you can either fork the repo (if you don't know how to use Github, check out these guides: <a href = "https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/"> Getting started with Github</a>, <a href = "https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/"> Forking repos</a>), or you can individually download each file. I would personally prefer the first method, but if you don't feel like learning the Github workflow, then this would be the way to go. Just make sure that when you do this, you download every file that's in the folder for the week you're interested in. Then, you can upload these files to datahub (I would recommend creating a new folder to dump these files into; you can make a new folder by clicking the "New" dropdown in the top right corner and selecting the "Folder" option. If you don't have accesss to datahub, you'll have to do this through a local installation of Jupyter. I'd recommend using Anaconda for this; the process for setting this up is detailed extensively in this <a href = "https://piazza.com/class/ixxlkoprjq27g5?cid=81">Piazza post</a>.
